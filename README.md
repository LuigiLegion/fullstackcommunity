# Description

Fullstack Community - Always Be Coding. Together.

Fullstack Community is a Fullstack Academy themed web app that connects past and present Fullstack students. The app allows current students and unemployed alums to form study groups and work on projects or practice algorithms together, while also allowing unemployed alums set up coffee meetings with employed alums that work for companies that they would like to work for in New York City.

The app was built using Node.js and Firebase on the backend, React.js, Redux.js, and Materialize.css on the frontend, and utilizes the Mapbox API and the MTA API. It was completed in under four days for a hackathon, and is continually being improved upon for the benefit of future Fullstack Academy and Grace Hopper generations to come.
